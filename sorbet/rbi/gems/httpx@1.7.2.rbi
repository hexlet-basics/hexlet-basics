# Implementation of a synchronous name resolver which relies on the system resolver,
# which is lib'c getaddrinfo function (abstracted in ruby via Addrinfo.getaddrinfo).
#
# Its main advantage is relying on the reference implementation for name resolution
# across most/all OSs which deploy ruby (it's what TCPSocket also uses), its main
# disadvantage is the inability to set timeouts / check socket for readiness events,
# hence why it relies on using the Timeout module, which poses a lot of problems for
# the selector loop, specially when network is unstable.
