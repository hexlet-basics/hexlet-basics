# ## Google Cloud hosting environment
#
# This library provides access to information about the application's
# hosting environment if it is running on Google Cloud Platform. You can
# use this library to determine which Google Cloud product is hosting your
# application (e.g. App Engine, Kubernetes Engine), information about the
# Google Cloud project hosting the application, information about the
# virtual machine instance, authentication information, and so forth.
#
# ### Usage
#
# Obtain an instance of the environment info with:
#
# ```ruby
# require "google/cloud/env"
# env = Google::Cloud.env
# ```
#
# Then you can interrogate any fields using methods on the object.
#
# ```ruby
# if env.app_engine?
#   # App engine specific logic
# end
# ```
#
# Any item that does not apply to the current environment will return nil.
# For example:
#
# ```ruby
# unless env.app_engine?
#   service = env.app_engine_service_id  # => nil
# end
# ```
#
# source://google-cloud-env//lib/google/cloud/env/lazy_value.rb#21

  # Most clients should not need to call this directly. Obtain a singleton

# A lazy value box with thread-safe memoization. The first time accessed
# it will call a given block to compute its value, and will cache that

# At most one thread will be allowed to run the computation; if another
# thread is already in the middle of a computation, any new threads
# requesting the value will wait until the existing computation is
# complete, and will use that computation's result rather than kicking
# off their own computation.
#
# If a computation fails with an exception, that exception will also be
# memoized and reraised on subsequent accesses. A LazyValue can also be
# configured so subsequent accesses will retry the computation if the
# previous computation failed. The maximum number of retries is
# configurable, as is the retry "interval", i.e. the time since the last
# failure before an access will retry the computation.

# retries have been exhausted) is maintained for the lifetime of the Ruby
# process. However, a computation can also cause its result (or error) to

# the next access following expiration, by calling

  # * `:computing` - A thread is currently computing the value. The
  #   second element is nil. The third elements is the monotonic time
