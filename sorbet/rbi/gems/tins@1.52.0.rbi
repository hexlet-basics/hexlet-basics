# Tins is a collection of useful Ruby utilities and tools that provide
# common functionality without requiring external dependencies. It's designed
# to be a lightweight, drop-in library that enhances Ruby's standard library
# with practical conveniences.
#
# @example Automatic class extensions
#   require 'tins/xt'
#
#   # Automatically extends core classes with useful methods
#   "foo".full? # => "foo"
#   "   ".full? # => nil
# @example Basic usage
#   require 'tins'

# The Tins::Blank module provides a consistent way to check if objects are

  # @example Basic usage
  #   [1,2,3].all_full?    # => [1,2,3]
  #   [1,nil,3].all_full?  # => nil
  # @example With block execution
