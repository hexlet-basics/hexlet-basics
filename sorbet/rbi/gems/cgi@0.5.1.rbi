# == Overview
#
# The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple protocol for passing an HTTP
# request from a web server to a standalone program, and returning the output
# to the web browser.  Basically, a CGI program is called with the parameters
# of the request passed in either in the environment (GET) or via $stdin
# (POST), and everything it prints to $stdout is returned to the client.
#
# This file holds the CGI class.  This class provides functionality for
# retrieving HTTP request parameters, managing cookies, and generating HTML
# output.
#
# The file CGI::Session provides session management functionality; see that
# class for more details.
#
# See http://www.w3.org/CGI/ for more information on the CGI protocol.
#
# == Introduction
#
# CGI is a large class, providing several categories of methods, many of which
# are mixed in from other modules.  Some of the documentation is in this class,
# some in the modules CGI::QueryExtension and CGI::HtmlExtension.  See
# CGI::Cookie for specific information on handling cookies, and cgi/session.rb
# (CGI::Session) for information on sessions.
#
# For queries, CGI provides methods to get at environmental variables,
# parameters, cookies, and multipart request data.  For responses, CGI provides
# methods for writing output and generating HTML.
#
# Read on for more details.  Examples are provided at the bottom.
#
# == About the Examples
#
# Examples on this page assume that \CGI has been required:
#
#   require 'cgi'
#
# Unless otherwise stated, examples also assume that environment variable 'REQUEST_METHOD' exists
# (which prevents CGI.new from entering its online mode):
#
#   ENV.include?('REQUEST_METHOD') # => true
#
# == Queries
#
# The CGI class dynamically mixes in parameter and cookie-parsing
# functionality,  environmental variable access, and support for
# parsing multipart requests (including uploaded files) from the
# CGI::QueryExtension module.
#
# === Environmental Variables
#
# The standard CGI environmental variables are available as read-only
# attributes of a CGI object.  The following is a list of these variables:
#
#
#   AUTH_TYPE               HTTP_HOST          REMOTE_IDENT
#   CONTENT_LENGTH          HTTP_NEGOTIATE     REMOTE_USER
#   CONTENT_TYPE            HTTP_PRAGMA        REQUEST_METHOD
#   GATEWAY_INTERFACE       HTTP_REFERER       SCRIPT_NAME
#   HTTP_ACCEPT             HTTP_USER_AGENT    SERVER_NAME
#   HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET     PATH_INFO          SERVER_PORT
#   HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING    PATH_TRANSLATED    SERVER_PROTOCOL
#   HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE    QUERY_STRING       SERVER_SOFTWARE
#   HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL      REMOTE_ADDR
#   HTTP_FROM               REMOTE_HOST
#
#
# For each of these variables, there is a corresponding attribute with the
# same name, except all lower case and without a preceding HTTP_.
# +content_length+ and +server_port+ are integers; the rest are strings.
#
# === Parameters
#
# The method #params() returns a hash of all parameters in the request as
# name/value-list pairs, where the value-list is an Array of one or more
# values.  The CGI object itself also behaves as a hash of parameter names
# to values, but only returns a single value (as a String) for each
# parameter name.
#
# For instance, suppose the request contains the parameter
# "favourite_colours" with the multiple values "blue" and "green".  The
# following behavior would occur:
#
#   cgi.params["favourite_colours"]  # => ["blue", "green"]
#   cgi["favourite_colours"]         # => "blue"
#
# If a parameter does not exist, the former method will return an empty
# array, the latter an empty string.  The simplest way to test for existence
# of a parameter is by the #has_key? method.
#
# === Cookies
#
# HTTP Cookies are automatically parsed from the request.  They are available
# from the #cookies() accessor, which returns a hash from cookie name to
# CGI::Cookie object.
#
# === Multipart requests
#
# If a request's method is POST and its content type is multipart/form-data,
# then it may contain uploaded files.  These are stored by the QueryExtension
# module in the parameters of the request.  The parameter name is the name
# attribute of the file input field, as usual.  However, the value is not
# a string, but an IO object, either an IOString for small files, or a
# Tempfile for larger ones.  This object also has the additional singleton
# methods:
#
# #local_path():: the path of the uploaded file on the local filesystem
# #original_filename():: the name of the file on the client computer
# #content_type():: the content type of the file
#
# == Responses
#
# The CGI class provides methods for sending header and content output to
# the HTTP client, and mixes in methods for programmatic HTML generation
# from CGI::HtmlExtension and CGI::TagMaker modules.  The precise version of HTML
# to use for HTML generation is specified at object creation time.
#
# === Writing output
#
# The simplest way to send output to the HTTP client is using the #out() method.
# This takes the HTTP headers as a hash parameter, and the body content
# via a block.  The headers can be generated as a string using the #http_header()
# method.  The output stream can be written directly to using the #print()
# method.
#
# === Generating HTML
#
# Each HTML element has a corresponding method for generating that
# element as a String.  The name of this method is the same as that
# of the element, all lowercase.  The attributes of the element are
# passed in as a hash, and the body as a no-argument block that evaluates
# to a String.  The HTML generation module knows which elements are
# always empty, and silently drops any passed-in body.  It also knows
# which elements require matching closing tags and which don't.  However,
# it does not know what attributes are legal for which elements.
#
# There are also some additional HTML generation methods mixed in from
# the CGI::HtmlExtension module.  These include individual methods for the
# different types of form inputs, and methods for elements that commonly
# take particular attributes where the attributes can be directly specified
# as arguments, rather than via a hash.
#
# === Utility HTML escape and other methods like a function.
#
# There are some utility tools defined in cgi/util.rb and cgi/escape.rb.
# Escape and unescape methods are defined in cgi/escape.rb.
# And when include, you can use utility methods like a function.
#
# == Examples of Use
#
# === Form Values
#
# ==== Get Form Values
#
# You can use method +cgi.params+ to retrieve form values
# in a {Hash}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Hash.html]:
#
#   ENV.update(
#    'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
#    'QUERY_STRING'   => 'a=111&&b=222&c&d='
#   )
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   cgi.params.class # => Hash
#   cgi.params       # => {"a" => ["111"], "b" => ["222"], "c" => [], "d" => [""]}
#   cgi.params.keys  # => ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
#   cgi.params['a']  # => ["111"]  # Returns an array.
#   cgi.params['d']  # => [""]     # Returns empty string in array if no value.
#   cgi.params['x']  # => []       # Returns empty array if no key.
#
# A \CGI instance has these convenience methods:
#
#   # Convenience method for cgi.params.keys.
#   cgi.keys          # => ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
#   # Convenience method for cgi.params[key].first.
#   cgi['a']          # => "111"  # Returns string, not array.
#   cgi['d']          # => ""     # Returns empty string if no value.
#   cgi['x']          # => ""     # Returns empty string if no key.
#   # Convenience method for cgi.params.include?.
#   cgi.include?('a') # => true
#   cgi.include?('x') # => false
#
# ==== Save and Restore Form Values
#
# This example uses {Pstore}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/PStore.html]
# to store and retrieve form values:
#
#   ENV.update(
#    'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
#    'QUERY_STRING'   => 'a=111&&b=222&c&d='
#   )
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   require 'pstore'
#   store = PStore.new('params.store')
#   store.transaction do
#     store['params'] = cgi.params
#   end
#   cgi.params.clear # Oops! Lost my params!
#   store.transaction do
#     cgi.params = store['params']
#   end
#   cgi.params # => {"a" => ["111"], "b" => ["222"], "c" => [], "d" => [""]}
#
# ==== Get multipart form values
#
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   value = cgi['field_name']   # <== value string for 'field_name'
#   value.read                  # <== body of value
#   value.local_path            # <== path to local file of value
#   value.original_filename     # <== original filename of value
#   value.content_type          # <== content_type of value
#
# and value has StringIO or Tempfile class methods.
#
# === Get cookie values
#
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   values = cgi.cookies['name']  # <== array of 'name'
#     # if not 'name' included, then return [].
#   names = cgi.cookies.keys      # <== array of cookie names
#
# and cgi.cookies is a hash.
#
# === Get cookie objects
#
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   for name, cookie in cgi.cookies
#     cookie.expires = Time.now + 30
#   end
#   cgi.out("cookie" => cgi.cookies) {"string"}
#
#   cgi.cookies # { "name1" => cookie1, "name2" => cookie2, ... }
#
#   cgi = CGI.new
#   cgi.cookies['name'].expires = Time.now + 30
#   cgi.out("cookie" => cgi.cookies['name']) {"string"}
#
# === Print http header and html string to $DEFAULT_OUTPUT ($>)
#
#   cgi = CGI.new("html4")  # add HTML generation methods
#   cgi.out do
#     cgi.html do
#       cgi.head do
#         cgi.title { "TITLE" }
#       end +
#       cgi.body do
#         cgi.form("ACTION" => "uri") do
#           cgi.p do
#             cgi.textarea("get_text") +
#             cgi.br +
#             cgi.submit
#           end
#         end +
#         cgi.pre do
#           CGI.escapeHTML(
#             "params: #{cgi.params.inspect}\n" +
#             "cookies: #{cgi.cookies.inspect}\n" +
#             ENV.collect do |key, value|
#               "#{key} --> #{value}\n"
#             end.join("")
#           )
#         end
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   # add HTML generation methods
#   CGI.new("html3")    # html3.2
#   CGI.new("html4")    # html4.01 (Strict)
#   CGI.new("html4Tr")  # html4.01 Transitional
#   CGI.new("html4Fr")  # html4.01 Frameset
#   CGI.new("html5")    # html5
#
# === Some utility methods
#
#   require 'cgi/escape'
#   CGI.escapeHTML('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>')
#
#
# === Some utility methods like a function
#
#   require 'cgi/escape'
#   include CGI::Escape
#   escapeHTML('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>')
#   h('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>') # alias

  # - <tt>tag_maker: _html_version_</tt>:
  #   specifies which version of HTML to use in generating tags.
  #
  #   Value _html_version_ may be one of:
  #
  #   - <tt>'html3'</tt>: {HTML version 3}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#HTML_3].
  #   - <tt>'html4'</tt>: {HTML version 4}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#HTML_4].
  #   - <tt>'html4Tr'</tt>: HTML 4.0 Transitional.
  #   - <tt>'html4Fr'</tt>: HTML 4.0 with Framesets.
  #   - <tt>'html5'</tt>: {HTML version 5}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#HTML_5].
  #
  #   Example:
  #
  #     CGI.new(tag_maker: 'html5')
  #
  #   If the option is not given,
  #   no HTML generation methods are loaded.
  #
  # With string argument +tag_maker+ given as _tag_maker_ and no block given,
  # equivalent to <tt>CGI.new(tag_maker: _tag_maker_)</tt>:
  #
  #   CGI.new('html5')
  #
  # <b>Outside a Standard Call Environment</b>
  #
  # This section assumes that <tt>ENV['REQUEST_METHOD']</tt> is not defined;
  # for example:
  #
  #   ENV['REQUEST_METHOD'] # => nil
  #
  # In this mode, the method reads its parameters
  # from the command line or (failing that) from standard input;
  # returns a new \CGI object.
  #
  # Otherwise, cookies and other parameters are parsed automatically from the standard CGI locations,
  # which vary according to the request method.
  #
  # <b>Options vs Public Methods</b>
  #
  # Some initialization options configure internal behavior only and do not provide
  # corresponding public getter methods:
  #
  # - <tt>accept_charset</tt>: Configures internal encoding for parsing.
  #   The <tt>accept_charset</tt> method returns the HTTP Accept-Charset header.
  # - <tt>max_multipart_length</tt>: Configures internal multipart size limits.
  #   No public getter method is available.
  # - <tt>tag_maker</tt>: Loads HTML generation methods (publicly accessible).
  #
  # <b>Block</b>
  #
  # If a block is given, its code is stored as a Proc;
  # whenever CGI::InvalidEncoding would be raised, the proc is called instead.
  #
  # In this example, the proc simply saves the error:
  #
  #   encoding_errors={}
  #   CGI.new(accept_charset: 'EUC-JP') do |name,value|
  #     encoding_errors[name] = value
  #   end
  #   # =>
  #   #<CGI:0x000002b0ec11bcd8
  #    @accept_charset="EUC-JP",
  #    @accept_charset_error_block=#<Proc:0x000002b0ed2ee190 (irb):146>,
