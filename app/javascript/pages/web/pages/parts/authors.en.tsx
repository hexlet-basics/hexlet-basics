      <p>
        When developing courses, content goes through certain stages: work with
        the author and methodologists, editors, and designers. Below we have
        collected the main recommendations and approaches that we use for
        writing text content.
      </p>

      <h2>How Our Recommendations Can Help:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Structuring your knowledge</li>
        <li>Identifying blocks of meaning in a text</li>
        <li>
          Determining the level of complexity of the material depending on the
          target audience
        </li>
        <li>Explaining complicated things in simple language</li>
        <li>Formatting, editing, and proofreading text</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>List of Recommendations</h2>

            <li>“From the general to the particular”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The introduction explains how the lesson is structured, what topics
          are covered, and why these topics are important
        </li>
        <li>The conclusion summarizes and lists the key points</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Paragraph and Sentence Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No monotonous passages with the same length of sentences</li>
        <li>

          “take note”)
        </li>
        <li>No sentences with hidden action (verbal nouns)</li>
        <li>
