      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
        distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
        regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so
        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

      <p>
        These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
        the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
        agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
        or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate
        as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the
        fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our
        rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
        responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
        caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
        part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful,
        void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
        deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
        venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between
        you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You
        agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue
        of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
        have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of
        signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
