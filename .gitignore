# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
# /services/app/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/services/app/db/*.sqlite3*
/services/app/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/services/app/log/*
/services/app/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp/*
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep

/services/app/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/services/app/config/master.key
