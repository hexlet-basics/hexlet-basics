            Oops, something went wrong on the frontend. Try refreshing the page.
            If that doesn’t help, see if it works in a different browser (sometimes browser extensions cause issues), or even with a different internet connection, like mobile data.
            And as a last resort, try clearing your cookies — if you know what that is :)
            We’ve already received the error and are checking it. If it’s on our side, the developers won’t get their morning coffee.
